<h1 align="center"> Virtual assistant </h1>

### Description
Many people and companies are looking for ways to improve their productivity, efficiency and reduce costs. Whether for example by automating repetitive or precise tasks.
And one of the tools that can facilitate these types of processes is a virtual assistant, since it may be able to understand and generate natural language effectively. Using machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence capable of making decisions and responding to different situations.
You can also integrate the virtual assistant with other systems, such as databases, calendar applications, email, etc. This can be achieved by using APIs and other means to connect different systems.

That is why I decided to create an interactive and fun virtual assistant, in order to entertain and cheer up the user who wants to use it.
It has 2 security methods implemented with it, one for voice recognition, and the other for facial recognition, it is necessary to pass both security filters in order to have access to all the tools that the virtual assistant can provide.

The user can connect their email, facebook, whatsapp, among other social networks or applications.
The user can ask general culture questions.
The user can take photos and apply any of the different styles implemented in the virtual assistant.
